# UniversalCalc

UniversalCalc is a versatile and comprehensive program designed to perform a wide range of calculations and conversions. Developed entirely in C, with a user-friendly interface built using the GTK library and compiled with MSYS2 MINGW64, this project showcases a structured and modular approach to software design for a calculator.

**Key Features:**
1. Statistical Calculations: Compute mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance from a list of numbers
2. Unit Conversions: Convert between various units, for instance kg to ml
3. Numerical Conversions: Convert between numbers, for instance binary to hexadecimal
4. Matrix Operations: Perform matrix multiplication, addition, and other operations on 3x3 matrices
5. General Calculator: Utilizes logarithmic, geometric and basic arithmetic functions

**Architecture:**
The application is structured with a single controller managing multiple pages each with its own view. This design allows for easy extension and modification. New pages can be added, and existing views can be extended, all while maintaining a consistent model.

**Notes**
This project was a personal endeavor aimed at practicing and improving my skills in C programming. While there are some bugs, the primary goal was to explore and learn, making it a valuable learning experience :)
